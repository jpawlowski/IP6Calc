README for ip6calc
====================

IPv6 address calculator

(c) Konrad Rosenbaum, 2009, 2012
this program is protected under the GNU GPLv3 or at your option any newer

This program is designed to calculate and merge IPv6 addresses

Building
---------

Simply call make in this directory or compile ip6calc.c with a compiler
of your choice. It should work on almost any POSIX compliant system.

Requirements: ANSI-C, GNU getopt

Using IP6Calc
---------------

see help.txt

Known Bugs, TODO
-----------------

The program currently does not understand IPv4-mapped addresses in the form
::1.2.3.4

There are no unit tests yet (this should be doable with a simple script).

"./ip6calc 2001:db8::" yields "2001:db8::0/64" instead of "2001:db8::/64"
